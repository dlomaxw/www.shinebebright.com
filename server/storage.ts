This marks a sharp acceleration from the 4.7 percent increase recorded in the previous quarter.\n\nUBOS officials noted that the rapid growth is driven by high demand in and around the capital, particularly in the Greater Kampala area. Wakiso District recorded the most significant jump in costs. Prices there rose 16.9 percent as buyers seek land outside the increasingly congested Kampala city center.",
